# Task1 - Data Cleaning

This repository contains an Excel file that has been cleaned and prepared for analysis. The following steps were taken:

 Data Cleaning Steps

1. Removed Missing Values:  Used the filter function to identify and remove rows with missing values in the relevant columns.
2. Removed Duplicate Rows:  Used the built-in "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate any duplicate rows.
3. Created Column Headers: Added a first row with appropriate column headers to identify the data in each column.
4. Renamed Column Headers: Renamed the column headers to be more descriptive and consistent.
5. Checked and Fixed Data Types: Ensured that all data in each column was of the correct data type (e.g., numbers, text, dates).
6. Removed Unwanted Spaces:  Used the "Trim" function to remove leading and trailing spaces from data cells.
7. Find and Replace: Used the "Find and Replace" feature to correct any inconsistencies or errors in the data.


This cleaned and prepared Excel file can now be used for:

* Data Analysis: Perform statistical analysis, create charts and graphs, and gain insights from the data.
* Data Visualization:  Create visually appealing dashboards and reports to present the data effectively.
* Data Integration:  Combine this data with other datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
